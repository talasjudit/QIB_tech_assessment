# Four tasks for the candidate

This directory contains for subdirectories, each one relates to a task assigned for the interview.

Each task has a dedicated README.md and one or more input files.

Add to each directory the code you will produce to solve the tasks, and eventually some documentation you think you would like to share (e.g. required dependencies such as a conda environment) in order to allow us running your script(s).

We will review your code and try to execute it using your instructions.

## What we are looking for

1. Attention to details: address the question as described in the readme
2. Quality of the produced code: readability, scalability, reproducibility, comments
3. Experience in bioinformatics tasks: ability to adopt good practices
4. You can create a private GitHub repository and invite @telatin for the review. This step is optional but welcome.

## Instructions for review

Please find the specific instructions in the README.md files within each subdirectory. Thanks!
